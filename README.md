I took a nav bar from bootstrap and fit it my needs. I eliminated the link from the nav bar on the pages currently being visited. The nav bar is otherwise consistant across all pages. It was a lot of work but I happy with what I was able to do with my first run at a website. I have thoroughly tested the website. Also I made frequent commits to GitHub. I used W3 schools code validator my code according to it has no errors. I ran out of time but in future updates to this site I definitly have ideas for improvement. More images put those cards in the portfolio page into a grid. Some of the asthetics in site are still rough but I feel I hit many of the requiremments in the assignment. Areas for further development Get Images up for the contact and About me pages. I have definite ideas for  java.scripts for this site. 

I have added my linked in profile to my portfolio page. Also a profile picture as well.Â
